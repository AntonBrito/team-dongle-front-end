## DONGLE
*An app to create web pages and blog posts*
by Hadley Sweck, Antonio Brito and Nick Rotondo

This app, inspired by WordPress, allows users to create pages and create blog posts after creating an account and signing in. Signed-in users can view all their own blog posts and pages, as well as view all blog posts created by all users with a Dongle account. Signed in users can see a list of their own pages and *click on them to edit or delete*. Signed in users can also edit and delete their own blog posts.

Our team's general approach began with appropriate planning. We were careful to keep our project scope within reason, given the time alotted. Our ERD evolved slightly, mostly with how to store pages. We had wireframes generally outlining what the views should look like, but expected the final version to vary as we coded it.

We began by establishing protocal for how we would use GitHub. This took a little practice while we were all together. For separation of tasks, Nick started by working mostly on setting up the API while Hadley worked on front-end functionality & learning Handlebars, and Tony focused on HTML structure and styling. For the most part, we started on opposite ends (front and back) and worked our way towards the middle (AJAX calls and event listeners).

For future iterations, we wold like to incorporate amazon web services to allow users to upload images for their posts or pages. We would also like to be able to add tags or categories to blog posts so users can filter what kinds of posts they wish to see.

This app should not need the user to install any dependencies - just go to https://ga-project-3-team-dongle.github.io/team-dongle-front-end/ and start viewing content!

## User Stories:
- As a signed-in user, I want to create (and edit) a webpages and blog posts.
- As a user without an account, I want to be able to see posts and pages created by users, so I can see the community and possibilities before deciding to join.
- As a signed-in user, I want to be able to access all of my pages and posts together from a dashboard, so I can manage the content in one place.
- As a signed-in user, I want to be able to see other users blog posts as well as my own.
